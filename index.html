      <h2>Is Name Trading Allowed?</h2>
      <p>
        <b>RuneScape name trading for <u>in-game gold</u> is NOT against RuneScape rules.</b> Jagex prohibits account sales and real-world trading (RWT), but name swaps using only in-game currency are fully permitted. We never encourage or facilitate RWT or account sales. <br><br>
        <i>“Trading a display name for gold is not considered RWT by Jagex policy, as long as no real-world money is involved.”</i>
