          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Is RuneScape name trading bannable?</h3>
            <p>No. Trading display names for <b>RuneScape gold only</b> is not against Jagex rules. <b>Real-world trading (RWT) for money is bannable.</b> All marketplace activity on NameScape is strictly RS gold only.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>How dangerous are name snipers?</h3>
            <p>Very. There are automated bots and human snipers waiting 24/7 for rare name drops. If you try to transfer a name without protection, <b>you will almost certainly lose it.</b> Never attempt a transfer alone.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>How do I safely transfer a RuneScape name?</h3>
            <p><b>Always use a trusted NameScape transferrer.</b> We use safe, time-tested methods and fast automation to prevent snipers from stealing your name. <b>Do not try to transfer by yourself or use unvetted services.</b></p>
          </div>

          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Can I trust DMs from admins?</h3>
            <p><b>No.</b> Never trust Discord DMs—even if they look like they’re from an admin. <b>We will never DM you first.</b> All trades and support must be handled inside a Discord ticket in our server. This is your only protection from imposters.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>What if someone offers me a good deal privately?</h3>
            <p><b>Only trade inside tickets on our Discord.</b> Our staff will never pressure you or ask for payment outside the server. Impersonators and scammers copy our profiles—verify all interactions.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>How do I get started?</h3>
            <p>Join our Discord, open a ticket, and our staff will guide you through the process. You’ll get step-by-step help, verification, and the safest transfer experience available.</p>
