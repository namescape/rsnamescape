          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3><u>Is RuneScape name trading bannable?</u></h3>
            <p>
              <b>No.</b> Trading display names for <b>RuneScape gold only</b> is not against Jagex rules. <b>Real-world trading (RWT) for money is bannable.</b>
              Our marketplace strictly deals with in-game gold for names—never real money, accounts, or third-party currencies.
            </p>

          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3><u>How dangerous are name snipers?</u></h3>
            <p>
              <b>Extremely dangerous.</b> Automated bots and human snipers are waiting 24/7 for rare name drops. If you try to transfer a name by yourself, you will almost certainly lose it. <b>Never attempt a transfer without a trusted transferrer.</b>
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3><u>How do I safely transfer a RuneScape name?</u></h3>
            <p>
              <b>Always use a NameScape trusted transferrer and open a ticket inside our Discord server.</b> We use secure, time-tested methods and the safest automation to prevent snipers from stealing your name. <b>Never attempt solo transfers or use unknown services.</b>
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3><u>Can I trust DMs from admins or staff?</u></h3>
            <p>
              <b>No.</b> Never trust unsolicited Discord DMs—even if they appear to be from staff. <b>We will never DM you first.</b> All trades and support are handled inside a Discord ticket on our server. This protects you from impersonators and scammers.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3><u>What should I do if someone offers a private deal?</u></h3>
            <p>
              <b>Create a ticket with us.</b> If you’re offered a deal outside of an official ticket, it’s almost always a scam. <b>Only trade inside tickets created in our Discord.</b> Never send gold or account info outside of our official process.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3><u>How do I get started?</u></h3>
            <p>
              Join our Discord, open a ticket, and our team will guide you step-by-step. You'll get safe, real-time help for your name trade or transfer.
