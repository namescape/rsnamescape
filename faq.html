          <h3>Is buying/selling RuneScape names bannable?</h3>
          <p>Trading display names for <b>RuneScape gold only</b> is not against the RuneScape rules. Jagex prohibits real-world trading (RWT) for money or items outside the game, but gold-for-name trades are permitted. <b>We never facilitate RWT or account sales.</b></p>

          <h3>How do I protect myself from “name snipers”?</h3>
          <p><b>Do NOT transfer a name yourself.</b> Sniping bots and scripts scan for new name releases 24/7 and will steal your name instantly. Only use a vetted, experienced transfer service like NameScape. We use proprietary timing and automation to ensure your transfer is safe and private.</p>

          <h3>How do I know I’m trading with a real admin?</h3>
          <p><b>Always make a ticket inside our Discord server.</b> Never trust DMs out of nowhere, even from users pretending to be staff; scammers copy our usernames and avatars. <b>We will never DM you first.</b> Tickets keep you safe from imposters.</p>

        <div class="faq-card">
          <h3>What payment methods do you allow?</h3>
          <p><b>RuneScape gold only.</b> We do not allow real money trading, accounts, or items. This keeps both you and us compliant with the game’s rules and safe from bans.</p>

          <h3>Can you transfer names between Old School and RS3?</h3>
          <p>Yes, our transferrers are experienced with both game versions. Please open a ticket for specific instructions and timing.</p>

          <h3>How do I start a safe name trade?</h3>
